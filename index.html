          <p>Hello, I am Murphy Poxson</p>
          <p>
            I am a computer science major at Oakland University and I am
            graduating May 2024. I grew up in Sterling Heights, Michigan and I
            graduated as a valedictorian from Henry Ford II High School. The
            past two summers I interned at Ally Financial in Detroit. I was an
            Automation Engineer for both internships. During the school year, I
            work as an IT Assistant for Oakland University. Before I came to OU,
            I worked at MJR Digital Cinemas as an usher and a supervisor. I
            would like to work as a software developer in the future. You can
            learn more about me on my
            <a href="./html/my_fun_facts.html">Fun Facts page</a> and on my
            <a href="./html/my_resume.html">Resume page</a>.
